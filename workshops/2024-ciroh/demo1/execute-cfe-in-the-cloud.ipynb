    "This notebook demonstrates how to build and execute scientific workflows in the cloud using cyberinfrastructure developed as part of the \"HydroShare Modernization\" CIROH research project. The goal is do illustrate how the general-purpose cloud analysis workflows that have been developed to support common data archival operations, can also be leveraged for scientific computing. This notebook describes the process for using the outcomes of the aforementioned CIROH project, however these capabilities are still under active development are not ready for wide-spread public use.\n",
